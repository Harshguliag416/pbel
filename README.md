## üß† Project Description

The goal of this project is to use IBM Watson Studio AutoAI to build a regression model that predicts housing prices using various categorical and numerical input features. The dataset was preprocessed and fed into AutoAI, which automatically generated multiple pipelines and selected the best one based on RMSE.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details

- Platform: IBM Watson Studio (AutoAI)
- Dataset: Housing.csv
- Model Type: Ridge Regression (Pipeline 8)
- API deployed using IBM Watson Machine Learning
- Best RMSE: ~1117271.79 (Cross Validation)
